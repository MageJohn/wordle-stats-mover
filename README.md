# Wordle Archive

On the 31st of January 2022, Josh Wardle, creator or [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), [announced he had sold the game to the New York Times](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1488263944309731329?s=20&t=1fM3dZ3N8TT4Q5gnjFnsnQ) leading to fears the game may go behind a paywall at some point in the future.

This is an archive of the game that can be played locally or self-hosted.

I do not own the rights to this code, I'm merely hosting it for posterity and for personal use. I do not recommed the reproduction of this code, particularly for commercial use.
